# You Shall Not Pass Usability Test Instructions

## Tasks

### Using the Slack Extention
You are a software developer, and you just set up a new database for your product. You want to share the credentials for this database (use `Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;`) with the rest of the development team by posting them in the #dev channel in Slack (send it to #testing-madeline for this test).

### Using the Web Interface

You are a Computer Engineering student working on a group project with three other classmates. Your group uses Facebook Messenger to communicate with each other. You have just written a component that requires a third-party API key (use `abcdef12345`). You want your teammates to be able to try out your component locally, so you need to share this API key with them.

Navigate to [youshallnotpass.org](youshallnotpass.org) and get a secure link to share the API key with your teammates (send it to Madeline Ferguson for this test). This link should expire in one week and only three total accesses should be permitted.

## How to Use

### Slack
1. Type `/` and then `youshallnotpass` and hit `enter`.
2. Type your secret surrounded by quote marks. The entry box should look like `/youshallnotpass "[insert secret here]"`
3. When you hit send, the bot will replace the secret with a secure link.
